# algos-illuminated
Implementations of algorithims described in Roughgarden's 2017 book, "Algorithms Illuminated, Part 1: The Basics"

## Setup

1. This project uses nix to handle dependencies. Follow the instructions [here](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/#installation) to set up Nix and devenv. You should only need to do steps a-c.
2. run `bundle install`
3. run `rspec` to run tests

You don't have to use devenv to run the project if you have you own way of managing ruby and packages, so do yer thing.
